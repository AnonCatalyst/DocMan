**DocMan: OSINT Document Manager**
=====================================
**Overview**
-----------
DocMan is a document management system designed to help manage large amounts of data and speed up investigative workflows in OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) work. The system will provide a centralized interface for creating, editing, and managing documents.

**Background**
-------------

DocMan is being developed in response to the needs identified during the [BackdropBuild](https://BackdropBuild.com) project, a collaborative effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of OSINT investigations. BackdropBuild is a 4-week program that runs from **July 8th, 2024** to **August 3rd, 2024**, where participants can work on their projects and receive funding and support.

**Expected Features**
--------------------

The following features are expected to be included in the initial release of DocMan, but please note that the development process may lead to changes, additions, or removals of features as needed.

### Document Management

* Centralized document repository for easy access and management
* Document templates for standardized reporting
* Version control and collaboration tools for multiple users
* Document tagging and categorization for easy organization

### Document Editing

* Integrated document editor with formatting and styling options
* Support for common file formats (e.g. PDF, DOCX, TXT)
* Real-time collaboration and commenting tools

### User Interface

* Intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and use
* Customizable dashboard for personalized workflow management
* Role-based access control for secure collaboration and data sharing

**Technical Details**
--------------------

The DocMan system is expected to be built using the following technologies:

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **GUI Framework:** PyQt6

The choice of Python 3.x and PyQt6 is based on their ease of use, flexibility, and extensive libraries for building robust and scalable applications.

**Design**
----------

The DocMan system will be designed with a modular architecture, allowing for easy integration of new features and components. The system will be built using modern software development practices and will be accessible via a desktop application.

**Benefits**
------------
`Unlike general-purpose document management tools, DocMan is built with OSINT in mind, making it more efficient and effective for documenting OSINT research. Its features will likely include organized note-taking, easy recording of digital information, and a secure and verifiable process for tracking notes, similar to Forensic Notes.`
* Improved efficiency and productivity in OSINT workflows
* Enhanced collaboration and data sharing capabilities
* Better organization and management of documents
* Increased accuracy and consistency in reporting

**Note on Feature Development**
-----------------------------

As development progresses, the features and design of DocMan may evolve based on user feedback, technical limitations, and emerging requirements. This document will be updated to reflect any changes to the expected features and design.

Please keep in mind that the final product may differ from the initial expectations, and we appreciate your flexibility and understanding throughout the development process.
